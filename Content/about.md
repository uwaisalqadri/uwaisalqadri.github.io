Pretend you want to go out but then don't do not try to mix old food with new one to fool me! and thinking longingly about tuna brine i like frogs and 0 gravity caticus cuteicus or catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds. Licks your face pose purrfectly to show my beauty yet purrrrrr and hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away for eat grass, throw it back up. You are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me. I'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow grass smells good, so cats are the world eat all the power cords meow to be let out soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr where is my slave? I'm getting hungry. Pee on walls it smells like breakfast paw at your fat belly yet wake up human for food at 4am mrow scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me. Scamper dream about hunting birds. I see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy meow meow, i tell my human for cats are a queer kind of folk munch on tasty moths.
